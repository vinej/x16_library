; x16lib :: gfx/shapes.asm -- circle, disc, flood fill (any bitmap)
; =====================================================================
; This file EMITS CODE. Source it exactly once (x16_code.asm does,
; under X16_USE_SHAPES).
;
; The shapes are ENGINE-AGNOSTIC and live here ONCE, not per engine:
; they draw through three entry symbols and read the canvas bounds
; through two, all overridable BEFORE this file is sourced. Left alone
; they bind to the 2bpp module (bitmap2). Any engine with the same call
; shapes can sit behind them:
;   - bitmap2 (2bpp): the default, no work.
;   - bitmap (8bpp): predefine SHP_PSET / SHP_HLINE to small shims that
;     move the colour from A into X16_P3 (where gfx_pset wants it), then
;     jmp gfx_pset / gfx_hline; SHP_READ = gfx_read; SHP_W/H = 320/240.
;   - CXGEOS points them at its graphics port and gets every mode at once.
;
;   SHP_PSET   pset:  P0/P1 = x, P2/P3 = y, A = colour (must clip)
;   SHP_READ   read:  P0/P1 = x, P2/P3 = y -> A = the pixel
;   SHP_HLINE  hline: P0/P1 = x, P2/P3 = y, P4/P5 = len, A = colour
;   SHP_W/H    the ADDRESS of a little-endian word: canvas w / h
;
; The P block is reloaded before every call, so the bound routines may
; clobber it freely; X16_T0..T7 are never touched here.
;
;   shape_circle  in: P0/P1 = cx, P2/P3 = cy, P4 = r (0-255), A = colour
;                 An outline, by the midpoint walk, plotted with
;                 SHP_PSET -- so it clips wherever pset clips.
;   shape_disc    same arguments, filled with spans. SHP_HLINE does not
;                 clip (the module policy), so keep a disc on screen.
;   shape_ellipse in: P0/P1 = cx, P2/P3 = cy, P4 = rx, P5 = ry (each
;                 0-255), A = colour. An axis-aligned outline by the
;                 midpoint walk, plotted with SHP_PSET -- so it clips
;                 wherever pset clips.
;   shape_fellipse same arguments, filled with spans. Like shape_disc
;                 it draws with SHP_HLINE, so keep it on screen.
;   shape_flood   in: P0/P1 = x, P2/P3 = y, A = colour. Scanline seed
;                 fill of the region containing (x,y). Bounds-checked
;                 against SHP_W/SHP_H, so it never reads off canvas.
;                 Carry set if the seed stack overflowed -- a very
;                 tortured region may come back incomplete.

; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
; One walk serves both: the error-form midpoint ellipse (Zingl),
; quadrant II from (-rx, 0) up to (0, ry), mirrored 4 ways by the
; circle's own shapes_pair4 / shapes_span2. The decision terms reach 2*rx*ry^2
; (about 33M at 255/255), so the arithmetic is 32-bit; the one setup
; product rx * 2ry^2 is a repeated subtract, a few thousand cycles at
; the very worst -- noise against the drawing itself.
;   dx = ry^2 - rx*2ry^2, dy = rx^2, err = dx + dy
;   each step: e2 = 2*err;
;     e2 >= dx ?  x++, err += dx += 2ry^2
;     e2 <= dy ?  y++, err += dy += 2rx^2
;   while x <= 0; then a centre column finishes the flat tips (small
;   rx). A row's widest span always lands before its narrower echoes,
;   so the fill's overdraw is harmless, same as the disc's.

; shape_polygon / shape_fpolygon -- regular convex polygons (X16_USE_SHAPES_POLY)
; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
; A regular N-gon: N vertices evenly spaced on a circle of radius r about
; (cx, cy), the first at byte-angle `rotation` (0 = east, 64 = south, the
; sin8/cos8 convention). shape_polygon draws the outline through SHP_PSET
; (so it clips like shape_circle); shape_fpolygon fills it with SHP_HLINE
; spans (so it does NOT clip -- keep it on screen, like shape_disc).
;
;   in: P0/P1 = cx, P2/P3 = cy, P4 = radius (0-255),
;       P5 = sides (3..POLY_MAX; fewer draws nothing, more is clamped),
;       P6 = rotation (byte angle), A = colour
;
; Vertices come from sin8/cos8 (hence the X16_USE_MATH dependency) scaled
; by r and rounded. The fill is a per-scanline convex span fill: for each
; row it finds the two edge crossings and draws between them, half-open at
; the bottom row so tiled polygons do not double-paint a shared edge. It
; is a one-shot primitive (cost ~ sides * height), not a per-frame filler.
;
; House style, as everywhere in this file: all labels are zone-locals with
; unique names (ACME's shape_flood__cheap locals do not reset at a zone-local routine
; label, so two routines could not each own an shape_flood__loop), and the work is cut
; into small routines so no branch reaches past its 127-byte range.

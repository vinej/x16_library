# VERA Macros

> Generated 64tass edition from `src_acme/tutorial`. Do not edit this copy by hand.

Detailed reference for the `X16_USE_VERA` macro gate.

Set the gate before sourcing the library:

```asm
X16_USE_VERA = 1
.include "x16.asm"
```

The macros in this file are thin 64tass macros around the routines in
`src_64tass/video/vera.asm`. They load immediate arguments into registers and then
call the runtime routine. Register contract for the routines: `A`, `X`, `Y`,
processor flags, and scratch bytes `X16_T0..X16_T2` may be clobbered unless a
macro notes otherwise.

For VERA addresses, `ADDR_H` is not just the high address byte. It contains:

| Bits | Meaning |
|---|---|
| bit 0 | VRAM address bit 16, usually `0` or `VERA_ADDR_H_BANK` |
| bit 3 | decrement flag, `VERA_ADDR_H_DECR` |
| bits 7:4 | auto-increment index, usually `VERA_INC_* << 4` |

Common increment constants are `VERA_INC_0`, `VERA_INC_1`, `VERA_INC_2`,
`VERA_INC_4`, `VERA_INC_8`, `VERA_INC_16`, `VERA_INC_32`, `VERA_INC_64`,
`VERA_INC_128`, `VERA_INC_256`, `VERA_INC_512`, `VERA_INC_40`,
`VERA_INC_80`, `VERA_INC_160`, `VERA_INC_320`, and `VERA_INC_640`.

## `#xm_vera_set_addr0 l, m, h`

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| Macro | `#xm_vera_set_addr0 l, m, h` |
| Purpose | Point VERA data port 0 at a runtime or macro-supplied VRAM address. Use this before reading or writing through `VERA_DATA0`, or before calling `#xm_vera_fill`. |
| Input parameters | `l`: low byte for `VERA_ADDR_L`; `m`: middle byte for `VERA_ADDR_M`; `h`: full `VERA_ADDR_H` value, including address bit 16 and the auto-increment/decrement bits. |
| Output parameters | None returned. VERA port 0 address registers are updated. |
| More info | The macro selects ADDRSEL 0 without disturbing DCSEL, then writes `VERA_ADDR_L/M/H`. Compose `h` yourself from the address bank bit and the increment index. For assembly-time constant addresses, the lower-level `#vera_addr 0, addr, inc` macro is often shorter. |
| Example | See below. |

```asm
VRAM_TEXT = $1B000

  ; Point port 0 at VRAM_TEXT and advance by one byte after each DATA0 access.
    #xm_vera_set_addr0 <VRAM_TEXT, >VRAM_TEXT, ((`VRAM_TEXT) & VERA_ADDR_H_BANK) | (VERA_INC_1 << 4)
    lda #'A'
    sta VERA_DATA0
```

## `#xm_vera_set_addr1 l, m, h`

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| Macro | `#xm_vera_set_addr1 l, m, h` |
| Purpose | Point VERA data port 1 at a runtime or macro-supplied VRAM address. This is most useful when copying from port 0 to port 1 with `#xm_vera_copy`, or when a routine needs a second independent VERA stream. |
| Input parameters | `l`: low byte for `VERA_ADDR_L`; `m`: middle byte for `VERA_ADDR_M`; `h`: full `VERA_ADDR_H` value, including address bit 16 and the auto-increment/decrement bits. |
| Output parameters | None returned. VERA port 1 address registers are updated. |
| More info | The macro selects ADDRSEL 1 without disturbing DCSEL, then writes `VERA_ADDR_L/M/H`. `VERA_DATA1` always accesses port 1, regardless of the current ADDRSEL bit. |
| Example | See below. |

```asm
VRAM_DEST = $1C000

  ; Point port 1 at VRAM_DEST and advance by one byte after each DATA1 access.
    #xm_vera_set_addr1 <VRAM_DEST, >VRAM_DEST, ((`VRAM_DEST) & VERA_ADDR_H_BANK) | (VERA_INC_1 << 4)
    lda #$20
    sta VERA_DATA1
```

## `#xm_vera_fill val, count`

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| Macro | `#xm_vera_fill val, count` |
| Purpose | Write the same byte repeatedly through `VERA_DATA0`, starting at the current port 0 address. Use it for fast clears, solid spans, repeated tile bytes, palette bytes, and any other linear or strided fill. |
| Input parameters | `val`: byte value to write; `count`: 16-bit byte count. |
| Output parameters | None returned. VERA port 0 advances according to the increment already configured in `VERA_ADDR_H`. |
| More info | You must point port 0 first with `#xm_vera_set_addr0` or `#vera_addr`. `count = 0` writes nothing. The routine stores `val`, count low, and count high in `X16_T0..X16_T2`, so do not expect those scratch bytes to survive. |
| Example | See below. |

```asm
VRAM_TEXT = $1B000

  ; Clear 80 bytes of text memory to PETSCII space.
    #xm_vera_set_addr0 <VRAM_TEXT, >VRAM_TEXT, ((`VRAM_TEXT) & VERA_ADDR_H_BANK) | (VERA_INC_1 << 4)
    #xm_vera_fill $20, 80
```

## `#xm_vera_copy count`

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| Macro | `#xm_vera_copy count` |
| Purpose | Copy bytes from VERA data port 0 to VERA data port 1. Use it for VRAM-to-VRAM blits when both source and destination can be streamed with VERA auto-increment. |
| Input parameters | `count`: 16-bit byte count. Before calling, port 0 must point at the source and port 1 must point at the destination. Each port keeps its own auto-increment/decrement setting. |
| Output parameters | None returned. Port 0 and port 1 both advance according to their configured increments. |
| More info | `count = 0` copies nothing. `VERA_DATA0` always reads port 0 and `VERA_DATA1` always writes port 1, so the copy loop does not need to switch ADDRSEL. The routine uses `X16_T1..X16_T2` for the count. Avoid overlapping source/destination regions unless the port increments and direction are chosen deliberately. |
| Example | See below. |

```asm
VRAM_SRC  = $1B000
VRAM_DEST = $1C000

  ; Copy 256 bytes from VRAM_SRC to VRAM_DEST.
    #xm_vera_set_addr0 <VRAM_SRC, >VRAM_SRC, ((`VRAM_SRC) & VERA_ADDR_H_BANK) | (VERA_INC_1 << 4)
    #xm_vera_set_addr1 <VRAM_DEST, >VRAM_DEST, ((`VRAM_DEST) & VERA_ADDR_H_BANK) | (VERA_INC_1 << 4)
    #xm_vera_copy 256
```

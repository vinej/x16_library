# PSG Macros

> Generated dasm edition from `src_acme/tutorial`. Do not edit this copy by hand.

Detailed reference for the `X16_USE_PSG` macro gate.

Set the gate before sourcing the library:

```asm
X16_USE_PSG = 1
include "x16.asm"
```

This page expands the compact listing from `macroguide.md`. Macro arguments are immediate values unless the entry says to pass an address, pointer, buffer, or preloaded state.

## `xm_psg_init`

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| Macro | `xm_psg_init` |
| Purpose | silence all 16 voices |
| Input parameters | No macro arguments. |
| Output parameters | No direct return documented. Expect normal routine register/flag clobbers unless the macro description says otherwise. |
| More info | Available when `X16_USE_PSG` is enabled. Related macros shown on the same line share the same purpose and calling pattern. |
| Example | See below. |

```asm
processor 65c02
include "x16.asm"

X16_USE_PSG = 1
include "core/sugar.asm"

    org $0801
    basic_stub

main
  ; Prepare voice 0 for a short confirmation beep.
    xm_psg_init
    rts

include "x16_code.asm"
```

## Reference: routines not covered above

Taken from each routine's own header in the source, so this
stays true as the module changes.

| Routine | Purpose | In | Out |
|---|---|---|---|
| `psg_voice_ptr` | point data port 0 at a voice register | X = voice (0-15), A = byte offset within the voice (0-3) | -- |
